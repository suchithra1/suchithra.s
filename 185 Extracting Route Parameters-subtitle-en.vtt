In the last lecture we added code to pass route parameters and I mention that you simply do this by

00:09.660 --> 00:16.860
wrapping your element in a lane as we do it there we don't use to we turn that into an absolute path

00:17.160 --> 00:23.680
and we pass post ID which we are able to receive because we set up a flexible path here.

00:23.790 --> 00:27.560
However we now need to retrieve that parameter too.

00:27.600 --> 00:30.030
So in the full post component there.

00:30.120 --> 00:33.220
Now this prop's ID doesn't work anymore.

00:33.810 --> 00:34.800
I print that.

00:34.800 --> 00:36.080
Props to the console.

00:36.090 --> 00:38.710
Earlier though if inspected.

00:38.830 --> 00:40.430
This is four different components.

00:40.440 --> 00:43.310
But the object always has the same structure.

00:43.380 --> 00:45.140
You see that under match.

00:45.270 --> 00:47.870
There actually is as parents object.

00:48.270 --> 00:59.580
And if we print console lock this props in our full post component there and important also turn component

00:59.580 --> 01:05.420
that update into component that mount because now we're not updating this.

01:05.580 --> 01:08.850
It's getting added or removed to and from the dawn.

01:08.850 --> 01:18.260
So this needs to be a component at Mount if we do that then we see the object in our post component

01:18.620 --> 01:23.250
and they're under a match we see that parents we have the ideal parent.

01:23.540 --> 01:30.950
And it's called I.D. because that is the name we set up as the name for this flexible element in this

01:30.950 --> 01:34.590
route definition in the block component.

01:35.120 --> 01:37.880
Now of course that allows us to extract this.

01:37.940 --> 01:45.530
So here we can not only log it we can also access this props match parents start ID and we know it will

01:45.530 --> 01:52.750
be there because this component is only loaded through this route which defines this idea Paran.

01:53.060 --> 02:01.060
So now if we save this you see we get an error here so something is better the error we do get is that

02:01.060 --> 02:06.080
somehow we still access the wrong ID the wrong post ID we're sending.

02:06.220 --> 02:12.610
Well the reason for that simply is to add in the full post we are making it to the HTP request but there

02:12.610 --> 02:14.840
we still access disk prop's ID.

02:14.840 --> 02:21.970
This of course also has to be this prop's match parents ID and with data if we save everything and we

02:21.970 --> 02:28.480
reload the app now it successfully loads post number free or if we exchange this with for post number

02:28.480 --> 02:29.070
four.

02:29.110 --> 02:32.130
And of course also if we click on them here.

02:32.530 --> 02:39.850
So now we really have an application where we have a dynamic element because we are successfully passing

02:39.850 --> 02:42.770
route parameters and extracting them.

02:42.790 --> 02:46.840
Now there are still a couple of things which don't exactly work to say we want to work.

02:46.870 --> 02:53.440
For example if you click on new post we are loading the new posts form but we also load that single

02:53.440 --> 02:54.580
post.

02:54.580 --> 02:57.560
Now do you know why this happens.

02:57.730 --> 03:01.360
Let's take a closer look at this issue and how to fix it in the next lecture.
