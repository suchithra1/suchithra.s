Let's dive right into it with LET and Konst these are two keywords who are going to see a lot in this

00:07.600 --> 00:13.970
course especially Konst lead and Konst are different ways of creating variables.

00:13.970 --> 00:17.920
You know we are we are it creates a variable in javascript.

00:17.930 --> 00:21.580
Now the thing is some variables never really change.

00:21.590 --> 00:23.750
They are so-called constants.

00:23.900 --> 00:25.360
Technically though they are.

00:25.370 --> 00:33.020
They are all just variables because javascript only knows war with as 6 a words of javascript two different

00:33.020 --> 00:41.180
keywords were introduced let and Konst are still works but you're highly encouraged to use LET and Konst

00:41.870 --> 00:42.730
let is.

00:42.770 --> 00:50.030
So to say Don't you want to use it for variable values and Konst are all changing something behind the

00:50.030 --> 00:52.750
scenes about the scope of variables.

00:52.850 --> 00:58.940
But the most important takeaway here is use LET if you want to create a variable that really is variable.

00:58.940 --> 01:05.600
Use Konst if you plan on creating a constant value so something which you only assign once and never

01:05.600 --> 01:06.400
change.

01:06.500 --> 01:09.710
And that is the case more often than you might think.

01:09.770 --> 01:16.490
In this course you will never see where you will only see lat and Konst and mostly it's Konst so it

01:16.490 --> 01:17.780
shouldn't confuse you.

01:17.900 --> 01:24.590
It's simply the same as a rule are just in a more modern way and in the case of Konst all the clearly

01:24.590 --> 01:28.570
showing days is never going to receive a new value.

01:28.850 --> 01:34.340
Now since it is always a bit clearer in practice let's have a look at it for this.

01:34.340 --> 01:35.950
It's best if you is a genius Ben.

01:35.970 --> 01:36.730
Dot com.

01:36.740 --> 01:42.920
That's another web editor which makes it easy for us to enter ASM javascript and see some console output

01:43.490 --> 01:50.130
for that disable H.T. mail and output up there and instead to enable Javascript and cons..

01:50.250 --> 01:55.780
Now on the left side you can right next generation javascript on the right side you'll see the output.

01:55.820 --> 01:57.460
So there we can create a variable.

01:57.500 --> 02:08.640
My name set an equal to max console lock my name and if you now had control enter you'll see Max on

02:08.640 --> 02:09.260
the right.

02:09.270 --> 02:12.300
Not that new to you probably.

02:12.300 --> 02:19.550
Obviously we can then set my name to menu and if we Denne console log my name again.

02:19.710 --> 02:25.210
It might also not totally surprise you that if you clear and run this again you'll see Max.

02:25.230 --> 02:29.220
From the first statement and menu from the second one.

02:29.310 --> 02:31.310
Now if change was to let.

02:31.310 --> 02:32.770
Nothing's going to change.

02:32.790 --> 02:39.750
Hitting run still works and the exact same way if you use Konst though like this.

02:39.780 --> 02:43.210
Then clearing and running this will output Max.

02:43.260 --> 02:50.480
But then throw an error or since we try to reassign a constant variable which is kind of a strange name.

02:50.720 --> 02:53.480
This is constant is the idea behind Konst.

02:53.550 --> 02:59.100
You can say this should never get a new value and if you didn't accidentally write some code where you

02:59.100 --> 03:03.580
reassign it you get the error and hence a chance to improve your code.
