In the last lecture I talked about Garth's Now one to consider for for a case so that we're accessing

00:09.840 --> 00:11.840
a route which is unknown.

00:11.910 --> 00:18.600
We actually saw one way of handling it with redirect here because if we try to access new posts when

00:18.600 --> 00:22.630
unauthenticated this route is unknown because it's not rendered.

00:22.670 --> 00:29.940
And as you could see if we still click on new post we are essentially redirected back to post.

00:29.960 --> 00:32.900
This is one way of handling for four requests.

00:32.900 --> 00:36.010
You can simply redirect to another route.

00:36.500 --> 00:40.430
However you can also handle them in a different way.

00:40.880 --> 00:47.750
If you want to handle them differently I have to comment is out of the way this will catch any unknown

00:47.750 --> 00:49.100
requests.

00:49.100 --> 00:57.410
You can specify the route component here and if you leave out the path so you don't add path you can

00:57.410 --> 01:06.080
simply define a component or the render method you learn about to render something for any unknown route.

01:06.080 --> 01:09.390
So here I'm going to outpoured not found.

01:09.440 --> 01:16.810
Of course you could again just said it use component and render for 0 for error page component you created

01:17.030 --> 01:21.900
but this route will catch any routes which are not handled prior to it.

01:22.070 --> 01:26.450
So any unknown routes in our case and it will output this.

01:26.660 --> 01:32.170
Now it won't work together with redirecting from the route route because it is all to catch us all and

01:32.170 --> 01:34.600
what ever order you use one or the other wins.

01:34.610 --> 01:39.920
So the other one doesn't do anything for any other use cases where you don't redirect from the route

01:39.920 --> 01:40.660
route though.

01:40.700 --> 01:42.270
You can use them together.

01:42.650 --> 01:50.390
But here this is a nice catch all route which should always come last and show an appropriate page or

01:50.390 --> 01:53.590
render some dummy content for unknown routes.

01:53.630 --> 01:59.420
Let me show this to you if we now click on new post which is unknown because we're not rendering that

01:59.420 --> 02:02.780
route component due to us not being authenticated.

02:02.900 --> 02:07.110
We see not found the same for the route you are alibied away.

02:08.470 --> 02:13.180
There we all the see not found because it's not defined right now.

02:13.180 --> 02:15.470
Posts still works though.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.190
So this is a catch all route.

02:18.200 --> 02:24.930
Another important concept especially for it for 4 cases to catch any unknown routes.

02:24.970 --> 02:31.930
Now as I said it won't work together with redirect if you redirect from slash if you redirect from any

02:31.930 --> 02:33.560
error page and slash.

02:33.580 --> 02:34.640
It'll work though.

02:34.690 --> 02:40.420
The reason they don't work together is that hear from is treated as a prefix and therefore does catch

02:40.420 --> 02:47.200
us all routes asked us this and therefore no matter how you order them it won't work together.

02:47.200 --> 02:53.920
I still wanted to show you both because you rarely have the case that two routes collide here and then

02:53.920 --> 02:59.940
you have a powerful way of handling four or four era cases with a route without a path.
