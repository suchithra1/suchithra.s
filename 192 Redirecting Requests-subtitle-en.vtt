So enough about route parameters and nested routes Let's talk about redirecting the user.

00:08.900 --> 00:11.190
Sometimes you want to redirect to user.

00:11.240 --> 00:18.350
For example let's say that you also want to lead the user to slash posts.

00:18.350 --> 00:25.280
If you visit just slash of course you can duplicate that route and also handle this slash case here.

00:25.430 --> 00:29.780
In this case you could render a component posts.

00:29.840 --> 00:36.640
Now if you save this and you reload the page you'll see that you load the post component.

00:36.650 --> 00:44.480
Even if you go onto shust slash without slash posts and if you then click on a post the link still leads

00:44.480 --> 00:46.900
to slash posts slash ID.

00:46.940 --> 00:49.340
So now you're back to the old world.

00:49.340 --> 00:51.590
This of course works and there's nothing wrong with it.

00:51.620 --> 00:56.930
You can definitely have multiple routes with different paths which render the same content.

00:57.020 --> 00:59.090
That's absolutely fine.

00:59.090 --> 01:03.950
I'm still going to comment this out because I want to show you a different solution.

01:03.950 --> 01:12.470
You can also use a special component provided by re-act router Dohm the redirect component.

01:12.670 --> 01:19.570
The redirect component as it is a component is simply used in your GSX code there.

01:19.610 --> 01:27.860
You can add it to your switch statement and then you specify a from properties so from which route you

01:27.860 --> 01:36.960
want to navigate to which for example from Slash to slash posts and then it's a self-closing component.

01:37.310 --> 01:44.300
If you use it outside of the switch statement from can't be specified then you can just always redirect

01:44.300 --> 01:49.630
to switch slash posts and not respect the path you were navigating to.

01:49.640 --> 01:54.770
I'll come back to conditional redirects outside of switch in the next lecture though.

01:54.980 --> 02:00.670
So now we have that redirect statement in the switch statement and it's just like another route.

02:00.680 --> 02:08.060
The only difference is it doesn't render content it simply just changes to you or Elea so that we don't

02:08.060 --> 02:11.380
reach another route for which we render content.

02:11.750 --> 02:19.520
If you save all of that and we now load our route your Allegan you'll see that you are changes to slash

02:19.520 --> 02:22.940
posts because we are redirected.

02:23.000 --> 02:31.130
This is how we can redirect to ensure that the user is removed or is well navigated to the route you

02:31.130 --> 02:32.580
want to have him on.

02:33.020 --> 02:34.310
That's redirection.

02:34.400 --> 02:40.210
However I just mentioned that there also is some conditional redirection we can use.

02:40.220 --> 02:43.590
Let me show you what I mean with that in the next lecture.
