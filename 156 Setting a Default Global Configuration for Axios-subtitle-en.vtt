In the last lecture I showed you how to add interest setters Now sometimes you don't want to intercept

00:07.670 --> 00:12.270
the request but you want to set up some global configuration.

00:12.470 --> 00:18.420
Let's say you are you are sending the requests to and your application is always the same.

00:18.560 --> 00:25.040
So it's always someplace or older type II code in our case here and then slash something.

00:25.040 --> 00:27.840
So that starting part is always the same.

00:28.130 --> 00:34.040
So what would be nice if we could cut it out here and just send the request to get posts and automatically

00:34.260 --> 00:37.980
apprentice to some comments starting your l.

00:38.000 --> 00:44.100
Turns out we can do that in the next index as fall which is a good place because it runs First it starts

00:44.100 --> 00:45.160
to react.

00:45.440 --> 00:52.040
We can use X years and their exes to defaults object to set up defaults which are true for all requests

00:52.070 --> 00:59.600
which are being sent and there we can find a base you are l and this you are l will now be used well

00:59.600 --> 01:05.420
as the names digests as a base your L to which d our POVs are then simply appended.

01:05.450 --> 01:11.110
Now with that set up here we have set by the way important should be base Eurail with capital characters

01:11.130 --> 01:13.650
here for the Ural casing is important here.

01:13.790 --> 01:18.480
Now we already removed it from get all posts here in the block container.

01:18.680 --> 01:23.730
Now in new post we can all get rid of it when posting data.

01:24.110 --> 01:31.760
And in the full post there we have two places one where we get to single post and one where we delete

01:31.840 --> 01:37.550
a single post so we can get rid of that starting your L everywhere and if we go back to the app you

01:37.550 --> 01:39.440
see it still loads it still works.

01:39.440 --> 01:47.810
Everything still works fine here because we didn't really change to the way we sent requests but we

01:47.810 --> 01:52.750
made it a bit easier for us because of that global configuration.

01:52.760 --> 01:56.560
Now you're also not limited to just adding the base your L here.

01:56.720 --> 02:05.030
You can also access defaults headers and there set a common header though on that common object of authorization

02:05.240 --> 02:11.450
common headers or simply the general headers which are set for all types of requests and there you could

02:11.450 --> 02:15.730
set this to your of token if you had one or whatever that is.

02:15.830 --> 02:23.350
You can also set headers just for specific request types like for post requests only where you maybe

02:23.370 --> 02:30.110
want to set the content type you're sending to application Chaisson which you don't need to that's the

02:30.120 --> 02:32.160
default anyways just to show this.

02:32.420 --> 02:38.420
So now if you do this if you go back to the application and you inspect the request which was sent you

02:38.420 --> 02:42.620
will see that under headers we've got the offerings sation autopen.

02:42.950 --> 02:50.570
And for a post request yeard we do that you will see that there if we inspect the request configuration

02:50.860 --> 02:53.810
we got the off reception header and Content-Type.

02:53.810 --> 02:55.970
Application Jason.

02:55.970 --> 02:58.280
So that's another cool feature of.

02:58.400 --> 03:04.640
Setting a default configuration which will be used application wide super awesome.

03:04.640 --> 03:08.140
Helps you to optimize your code quite a lot.
