00:02.170 --> 00:09.160
In the last lecture we started building the check out container or we actually built it.

00:09.420 --> 00:17.220
But now once loaded with routing for that I'll quit the start process because I'll install a new package

00:17.310 --> 00:24.690
with NPM install dash dash save to store entry in the package touch base and fall and then it's re-act

00:24.690 --> 00:26.080
router dorm.

00:26.100 --> 00:35.230
Now as mentioned in an article in the re-act router module you can install re-act router reactor our

00:35.250 --> 00:39.100
Dawn does Rapide and does have it as a dependency.

00:39.210 --> 00:40.610
But you don't need to.

00:40.650 --> 00:45.880
We will only work with reactor Dohm your so that is all we need to install.

00:45.930 --> 00:49.090
Still installing the package too won't hurt you.

00:49.110 --> 00:52.430
It's not increasing the bundles size or anything like that.

00:52.470 --> 00:56.530
You can stall it explicitly but you don't need to.

00:56.540 --> 01:00.830
So with that let me now run NPM start again.

01:01.630 --> 01:08.390
And now that the routing is set up or that the router was installed I want to take advantage of it to

01:08.390 --> 01:13.250
load ever the Bergere Buller or the checkout.

01:13.250 --> 01:19.460
Now as you learn for that we need to wrap everything where we want to use routing with the browser router

01:20.150 --> 01:23.680
and I will do that in the index jr's fault.

01:23.810 --> 01:27.160
Though you could do it in the aperture as Faltu.

01:27.530 --> 01:30.590
I want to wrap my whole app though so I'll do it here.

01:30.650 --> 01:32.890
And this is a good place to do it of course.

01:33.630 --> 01:42.810
For that I'll add a new import in the asphalt from re-act router Daum And the thing I want to import

01:43.470 --> 01:46.260
is the browser router.

01:46.680 --> 01:49.050
Now create a new constant which I'll just name.

01:49.090 --> 01:50.440
App.

01:50.580 --> 01:57.210
I'll use parentheses to be able to write multi-line GSX code and then I'll use the browser rowdier opening

01:57.210 --> 02:04.290
and closing tag and in between I'll put my app like this.

02:04.480 --> 02:13.440
And now I'll use the app constant I just create it down there as an argument to pass it down here in

02:13.450 --> 02:15.290
re-act Tom render.

02:15.300 --> 02:18.030
Now we can use routeing in our package.

02:18.080 --> 02:20.320
Does this routing enabled.

02:20.340 --> 02:26.040
Now let's set up some routes and let's do this and he actually has followed where I currently load both

02:26.130 --> 02:29.610
the Burgert Boulder and checkout to set up routing.

02:29.670 --> 02:39.500
I'll import the route component from re-act router DOM like this and now instead of using Berbel or

02:39.560 --> 02:48.810
or check out like it is hard coded in there are or route with a pop and then with component to render

02:48.810 --> 02:50.150
some component here.

02:50.270 --> 02:55.130
It's a self-closing component because you don't need to pass anything between opening and closing tag.

02:55.130 --> 02:56.960
I actually can't.

02:56.960 --> 03:08.180
So here for payoff for just slash so for Drood path I want to load my burger Baldor component and then

03:08.210 --> 03:17.710
duplicate this because for Slash checkout I want to load the checkout component.

03:18.080 --> 03:23.200
Now with the current set up both would be loaded because POF is treated as a prefix.

03:23.240 --> 03:27.440
So this would always be a hit and for checkout this would be a hit too.

03:27.470 --> 03:32.810
So for checkout bouffe would be loaded for Bergere Boulder disk would be loaded but we would always

03:32.810 --> 03:34.950
load this because of that.

03:34.970 --> 03:42.680
Treat me as a prefix standard we can add the exec property to prevent this or we use to switch component

03:42.680 --> 03:44.390
to wrap our routes.

03:44.470 --> 03:51.890
You only get one hit but then we also need to change the order with exact order doesn't matter here

03:51.920 --> 03:59.000
because it's not treated as a prefix it's not catching everything with out exact order would matter

03:59.270 --> 04:06.650
so I'll change the order and use SFC and use switch to just to show everything though that isn't all

04:06.650 --> 04:09.470
required for this setup at least.

04:09.470 --> 04:14.760
So I'll still rapid with switch so we only load one of these routes.

04:14.780 --> 04:18.300
The first one which matches the path the given path.

04:18.710 --> 04:22.880
So now we should only see the burger Baldor again and we do.

04:22.880 --> 04:25.890
There is no other part loaded.

04:26.120 --> 04:33.500
The next step of course is to make sure that when we click on continue in this Modal did we also navigate

04:33.530 --> 04:37.160
to slash checkouts so that we can see death route instead.

04:37.220 --> 04:39.210
Let's do this in the next lecture.
