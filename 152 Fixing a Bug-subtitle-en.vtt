So over the last lectures I introduced you to how you send requests to access.

00:06.870 --> 00:10.470
Now I found a little bug which I didn't recognize earlier.

00:10.480 --> 00:16.930
We of course don't see the body here for the chosen post that simply happens because in the full post

00:16.930 --> 00:22.120
component I try to load content here but body would be correct.

00:22.210 --> 00:28.180
So exchange content with body and you will see the post body of course everything else still works.

00:28.210 --> 00:30.530
Before that cestus a tiny fix.

00:30.580 --> 00:31.570
I want to apply.
