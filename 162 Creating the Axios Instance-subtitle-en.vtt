00:01.990 --> 00:07.330
So in the last lecture we do get at this firebase project and we had changed the rules.

00:07.470 --> 00:14.730
Now let's start sending HTB requests to this endpoint and to send HTP requests.

00:14.730 --> 00:18.970
We of course should install a new package in our course project.

00:19.050 --> 00:25.830
We do this with NPM install dash dash save x yes is the package I want to install because you're just

00:25.830 --> 00:27.690
like any HTP module.

00:27.730 --> 00:31.890
Want to use axes to set my age to keep the requests.

00:31.890 --> 00:38.210
You can of course use different Ajax package but actually is really great and I can only recommend it.

00:38.250 --> 00:43.260
Thereafter we can restart the daemon opens her with NPM start.

00:43.530 --> 00:47.290
And now of course we want to add access to our application.

00:47.550 --> 00:55.020
In the last course module use all different ways of adding it adding it by creating an access instance

00:55.290 --> 01:00.000
or simply importing it and potentially setting up some defaults.

01:00.000 --> 01:08.700
Now I will added by adding xes instance but you could also just imported globally and set these global

01:08.700 --> 01:10.940
defaults you saw in the last module.

01:11.010 --> 01:12.900
Definitely play around with both.

01:12.930 --> 01:15.110
Choose whichever one you like more.

01:15.210 --> 01:22.900
Now to create an instance of X years I'm going to create a new file and I'm going to name these X's

01:23.310 --> 01:30.600
orders dot Jesus because of go use that for all the order related stuff in there there I now need to

01:30.630 --> 01:38.010
import x years from the ex-US package and then call X create and pass a javascript object to configure

01:38.010 --> 01:38.780
it.

01:38.790 --> 01:46.050
Now there are set up the base you are l to that lbf I just copied from firebase dessous your you are

01:46.050 --> 01:50.760
Alwar you want to send your request to to store your data in the database.

01:50.820 --> 01:55.260
And again just in case you missed it it's this part.

01:55.440 --> 02:02.280
You can see under database Dator that is what I set up as my default base your L here of course does

02:02.330 --> 02:08.820
it says which gets created here should be stored in some constants or a constant or variable and naming

02:08.820 --> 02:09.910
it instance here.

02:10.110 --> 02:13.520
And then I can export this as the file default.

02:13.530 --> 02:18.100
Now I have my own access instance configured for this your et al.

02:18.140 --> 02:23.670
This is also the reason why I use this instance approach because later in the course when we add authentication

02:23.760 --> 02:27.230
we'll all use a different u r l with x yes.

02:27.240 --> 02:34.230
So I don't want to set to space you or as a global default even though for the moment I could do that.

02:34.260 --> 02:36.640
So now we get the access instance created.

02:36.690 --> 02:37.570
That's great.

02:37.590 --> 02:40.440
Let's now Vaun to actually sending requester.
