00:02.190 --> 00:04.630
So let's use this firebase service.

00:04.680 --> 00:09.470
As I said simply just as kind of a dummy back end because it's easy to get started with it.

00:09.630 --> 00:12.600
And for our needs here it's free.

00:12.600 --> 00:18.480
Check out the pricing page on fire based at Google dot com slash pricing to learn what's included in

00:18.480 --> 00:21.580
the free plan and when it's going to cost money.

00:21.600 --> 00:28.080
That's especially important of course if you plan on using days in production environments for your

00:28.170 --> 00:29.670
real application.

00:29.670 --> 00:34.370
No worries though if you stay in the free plan you actually can't be charged.

00:34.470 --> 00:40.080
You'll just be limited once you exceed the free limits which of course you also don't want to encounter

00:40.170 --> 00:43.040
in your protection ready application.

00:43.050 --> 00:46.020
Now enough of the talking about the pricing it's free for our needs.

00:46.020 --> 00:49.810
So let's click on go to console for Dad you'll need a Google account.

00:49.830 --> 00:53.530
So that is something you will need to create before you can continue.

00:53.670 --> 00:57.710
And on that console you can now create a new project here.

00:57.960 --> 01:04.350
So let's create the project I'm going to name a re-act my burger you can choose any name you like.

01:04.350 --> 01:09.450
And then you choose a country or region here and you can choose to a country where you are located.

01:09.510 --> 01:13.980
This won't affect where the data will be stored in the end.

01:14.310 --> 01:16.320
And then click Create project.

01:16.450 --> 01:21.770
As I said this will now configure up back and project for you which automatically gives you some rest.

01:21.780 --> 01:29.430
API endpoints and Mongo D-B like database which you can use to store data so that we don't have to write

01:29.490 --> 01:31.080
any server side code.

01:31.170 --> 01:33.300
The console is going to look like this.

01:33.410 --> 01:34.520
Now no worries.

01:34.520 --> 01:37.430
You don't need any deeper firebase understanding here.

01:37.440 --> 01:43.490
We're going to use the database because we want to store data and firebase has is Sendak's Where the

01:43.500 --> 01:48.810
API endpoints are directly mapped to endpoints or two tables.

01:48.840 --> 01:51.250
You could say in your database.

01:51.330 --> 01:55.620
So it's super easy to get started storing data there.

01:55.650 --> 01:58.910
Now this is the API endpoint.

01:58.920 --> 02:04.080
We're going to use so you of course have a different one for your project but this is the end point

02:04.080 --> 02:09.560
where we can send data to you and then it will automatically be stored in that database.

02:09.570 --> 02:12.710
Still we won't be connecting to the database directly.

02:12.780 --> 02:19.610
We're just sending HTP request and firebase is doing the mapping of HTP endpoints to the database.

02:19.620 --> 02:25.260
That's the cool thing about this service now for this to be available there's one thing we need to set

02:25.260 --> 02:33.660
up under rules here on database rules you should set read and write x' simply to true.

02:33.690 --> 02:36.910
Now by default it's only enabled for authenticated users.

02:37.000 --> 02:40.790
And this makes sense for production ready application.

02:41.010 --> 02:43.770
But we haven't implemented user authentication yet.

02:43.830 --> 02:46.070
So we have know of any kind of users.

02:46.260 --> 02:51.080
So for the moment let's turn this to true so that everyone can read or write.

02:51.120 --> 02:55.950
Of course not something you want for your real application which you ship.

02:56.070 --> 03:00.020
At least that's the most likely use case that you don't want to give global.

03:00.030 --> 03:01.650
Read or write access.

03:01.650 --> 03:03.990
Make sure to publish your updated rules.

03:04.230 --> 03:06.120
And with that we're already ready to go.

03:06.150 --> 03:06.930
That's all.

03:06.960 --> 03:08.790
We don't have to configure anything else.

03:08.850 --> 03:15.750
We can get started and we can start sending HPB request to dis and point or some nested endpoints as

03:15.750 --> 03:17.100
you going to see.

03:17.250 --> 03:18.820
Now with that in the next lecture.

03:18.840 --> 03:25.170
Let's dive right into that and let's start sending HTP requests to our Bacchante here.
