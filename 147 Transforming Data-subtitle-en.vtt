In the last lecture we fetched some post data and we can render it to the screen by updating our state.

00:08.550 --> 00:14.990
But of course we're fetching too many posts here now for a real application.

00:15.000 --> 00:20.280
You probably can send some query parameter to your back and to restrict the amount of data you want

00:20.280 --> 00:22.880
to fetch some pagination basically.

00:23.160 --> 00:26.370
But of course we can all transform the data once we got it.

00:26.370 --> 00:29.160
So here I'll add a new constant posts.

00:29.190 --> 00:36.300
I'm now in the van block of component that mount and sign response data here.

00:36.540 --> 00:43.380
Now I'll call the slice method on that array and only get the elements 1 to 4 to only fetch the first

00:43.380 --> 00:44.600
four posts.

00:44.610 --> 00:51.360
Actually I fetched him all but I only store 4 of them in that post constant of them create a second

00:51.360 --> 00:57.290
constant updated posts even because I want to add an awful field to my posts.

00:57.300 --> 01:02.540
Now typically you would of course get this from your back end but are fake back and doesn't have it.

01:02.700 --> 01:08.010
So I simply added here to all to show you that of course you can edit the data you fetch from the server.

01:08.010 --> 01:13.090
We're just working with javascript in the end so we can add any javascript code we want.

01:13.470 --> 01:22.920
So here I will take my posts called a map method on them and for each post I want to return a new javascript

01:22.950 --> 01:30.610
object where I distribute the property off the post so the properties we got from the server basically.

01:30.990 --> 01:38.640
And then also add a new offer property which all hard code to max with data go got the updated posts

01:38.650 --> 01:42.660
now and I'll set the posts to my steady state to them.

01:42.660 --> 01:49.890
Now the data we get back from the server was shortened and transformed in that we added the offer field

01:50.280 --> 01:55.170
and that of course is just one example of transformation to showcase that you can of course work with

01:55.170 --> 02:00.270
the data you will get back before setting it to the state with that change in place.

02:00.270 --> 02:05.990
We now got that off revealed that all is a field of one output in that post element.

02:06.210 --> 02:08.380
So there I expect to get.

02:08.820 --> 02:10.410
Offer Propp.

02:10.500 --> 02:14.100
I can now set this prob in the block container here.

02:14.220 --> 02:14.710
I can.

02:14.740 --> 02:25.080
All the pastis this offer should be post offer that offer field we just added to each object we store

02:25.080 --> 02:26.230
in the state.

02:26.370 --> 02:31.960
We save this we now see the offer here and we see only four posts.

02:32.010 --> 02:37.590
This is how you can transform the data how you can work with the data in component did MT.

02:37.590 --> 02:38.520
In this example.
