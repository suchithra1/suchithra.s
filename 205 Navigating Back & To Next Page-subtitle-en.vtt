00:02.140 --> 00:08.010
So we can whiz at the check out page on the check out page let's make the buttons which are part of

00:08.020 --> 00:13.190
check out summary work to cancel and continue button.

00:13.240 --> 00:18.460
Now these buttons are of course in the check out summary I could handle them there by turning it into

00:18.460 --> 00:27.870
a class but I just want to expose this event basically in a check out container which wraps the check

00:27.870 --> 00:34.240
out summary component by using the skittled approach of using props and then any props I expect to get

00:34.300 --> 00:38.930
the reference to the method which should be executed upon a click at.

00:39.220 --> 00:41.860
So here I will name is on.

00:41.860 --> 00:50.600
Check out canceled or just check out can't be in line with my previous namings and then your props check

00:50.600 --> 00:52.650
out continued.

00:52.650 --> 00:56.340
Now I need to implement these props when using the check out summary component.

00:56.490 --> 01:05.350
So there I don't only passing read the ends I also have check out canceled and I have checked out continued.

01:05.610 --> 01:10.680
Now any methods which do something upon each of the two I'll add.

01:10.710 --> 01:17.850
Check out canceled handler which is a method which should do something and I'll use this method syntax

01:17.850 --> 01:26.070
to be able to use the this keyword inside of there and check out continued handler which should also

01:26.580 --> 01:28.130
look like that.

01:28.140 --> 01:35.310
Now since I'm in the check out container which was loaded with the route component we here also have

01:35.310 --> 01:42.390
access to this props and there too the history Propp and the history Propp also has a go back method

01:42.390 --> 01:44.990
which I want to execute upon cancelling.

01:45.000 --> 01:52.440
This simply goes back to the last page in the Arrow case here where I want to continue all use replace

01:52.440 --> 02:02.690
instead to replace the current route with check out slash contact data for example we don't handle this

02:02.780 --> 02:10.010
part yet but this should be the part which soon loads the contact data component which we don't have

02:10.010 --> 02:11.390
yet again.

02:11.420 --> 02:15.230
Now we need to hook these handlers up so down there.

02:15.530 --> 02:20.690
This check out canceled handler and does check out continued handler should be used.

02:20.870 --> 02:24.190
Save all the false and now let's try this out on.

02:24.230 --> 02:29.140
Check out if I click on cancel and take it back to my Bergrin builder.

02:29.360 --> 02:34.430
Let me go back to checking out if I click Continue.

02:34.550 --> 02:39.910
You'll see your changes but of course that doesn't do anything because we're not handling it yet.

02:40.010 --> 02:43.590
So this is something I will have to handle in the future.

02:43.820 --> 02:50.390
The thing I want to do before handling debt though is that I want to render the burger I really build

02:50.690 --> 02:55.010
and not some arbitrary burger here to render the burger.

02:55.010 --> 03:04.010
I actually bult I will have to pass the respective data about my burger to the checkout page.

03:04.010 --> 03:11.030
So from the Bergere Boulder here there I build some burger and if I now click ordering now and continue

03:11.300 --> 03:19.100
I need to pass data about ingredients onto the checkout page disaster next goal past the data on.

03:19.100 --> 03:25.960
I want to pass it on why a query parents here again feel free to implement this on your own.

03:26.030 --> 03:31.380
You learn everything you need for days over the last module will do it together in the next lecture.
