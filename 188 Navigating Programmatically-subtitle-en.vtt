00:02.110 --> 00:05.560
So now were successfully passing parameters and using them.

00:05.690 --> 00:09.380
Let me now go back to that Post's component again.

00:09.650 --> 00:15.830
Right now we're using a link to load a single post and navigate to its page and there's nothing wrong

00:15.830 --> 00:17.190
with that.

00:17.210 --> 00:24.320
However I now want to show you an alternative and for this or comment out the link heart here with a

00:24.320 --> 00:30.470
normal comment because I'm not inside GSX here so I don't raptus in a link.

00:30.480 --> 00:36.520
Therefore I need to add the key to post again because now post is again the top most element in our

00:36.520 --> 00:37.770
array we're returning.

00:38.090 --> 00:40.490
But now I'm not using link any more.

00:40.820 --> 00:46.760
And I can therefore remove the import and actually remove the whole import statement.

00:46.760 --> 00:50.220
I have to find some other way of going to that post.

00:50.390 --> 00:56.150
And remember that we have this clicked listener where we execute this post selected handler where we

00:56.150 --> 00:57.960
also pass the ID.

00:58.370 --> 00:59.710
We can use that method.

00:59.720 --> 01:01.950
And here I don't want to use the state instead.

01:01.960 --> 01:04.230
I want to navigate programmatically.

01:04.490 --> 01:10.070
And I was showing this here as a demo of course using the link would be fine for this use case but you

01:10.070 --> 01:16.640
also sometimes have use cases where you want to navigate after something finished after HTP request

01:16.640 --> 01:17.060
was sent.

01:17.060 --> 01:20.080
For example we'll see this again later.

01:20.090 --> 01:25.770
Now to do this we can take advantage of that history object we received on the props.

01:25.850 --> 01:32.600
Remember here in the props we got history and there we actually have some functions we can execute functions

01:32.720 --> 01:38.690
for navigating around like go back or go forward which do exactly what they sound like they basically

01:38.690 --> 01:41.910
do the same you have with the forward and backward buttons.

01:41.960 --> 01:50.360
There also is this push method which allows you to push a new page onto the stack of pages because navigation

01:50.600 --> 01:53.860
basically just is about a stack of pages.

01:53.900 --> 01:59.420
That is why the back and forward buttons work in the browser because you can go back to the last page

01:59.450 --> 02:05.100
on the stack or forward again to that page on the stack you have on the top of it.

02:05.120 --> 02:07.330
Before you went back.

02:07.340 --> 02:12.160
So therefore we can use this prop's history push.

02:12.530 --> 02:23.690
And then a string or Also an object so essentially the same we use in router link on the two property

02:24.200 --> 02:27.080
to navigate to a page.

02:27.110 --> 02:36.300
So there we could navigate to a javascript object where a said lbf name to slash and then plus the ID.

02:36.410 --> 02:41.650
And this is just the same I had down there with link to just using the object notation.

02:41.720 --> 02:48.350
But again the alternative which I'll comment out would be to just go to slash plus ID.

02:48.350 --> 02:52.220
So just passing a string so both will work now.

02:52.680 --> 02:53.560
And with.

02:53.600 --> 02:59.910
If I go back to my application to home and I click on a post that still works.

02:59.960 --> 03:07.430
Now however programmatically and chust demonstrate that it does work even with the Aberg notation let

03:07.430 --> 03:09.690
me comment it this way.

03:09.710 --> 03:15.000
Now if I go back to home and click on a post we still go to that post.

03:15.070 --> 03:21.950
So now we're navigating program magically which can be important from time to time mostly used after

03:22.040 --> 03:23.730
a given operation finished.
