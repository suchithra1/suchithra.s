00:02.210 --> 00:04.030
So let's get started with that course.

00:04.070 --> 00:09.200
But first I want to explain you how you can get the most out of this course.

00:09.200 --> 00:14.950
Obviously you watch the videos and I highly recommend that you all to code along right.

00:14.960 --> 00:16.260
Decode yourself.

00:16.400 --> 00:18.640
This is how you learn the most.

00:18.650 --> 00:21.110
Additionally check my source code.

00:21.230 --> 00:27.170
If you are encountering issues you can find it attached to the end of each module and also to a lot

00:27.170 --> 00:34.170
of lectures for all the module and I do provide the source code because sometimes it's just a tiny typo

00:34.580 --> 00:39.770
and if you don't run my source code and compare it to yours you won't be able to find out what's wrong

00:39.770 --> 00:44.360
in your code and get a deeper understanding of why it went wrong.

00:44.360 --> 00:47.640
Also consider D many hints and things.

00:47.660 --> 00:50.970
I will teach you in the debugging section of this course.

00:51.080 --> 00:56.560
There I will teach you how to handle re-act errors and how to react to them and fix them.

00:56.750 --> 00:59.470
Definitely something you have to know how to do.

00:59.540 --> 01:04.460
So use that knowledge you gain there to fix any issues you encounter.

01:04.460 --> 01:10.070
Now if you're stuck and you can't find error ask in the Q and A section.

01:10.070 --> 01:13.940
My team and I are more than happy to help you there but that's important.

01:13.940 --> 01:15.500
Don't just ask there.

01:15.590 --> 01:17.360
Also answered there.

01:17.360 --> 01:19.970
I'm not saying this because I don't want to answer your questions.

01:20.000 --> 01:25.220
I will but if you answer you'll learn way more than if you ask.

01:25.220 --> 01:27.740
Asking is so simple but answering is hard.

01:27.770 --> 01:29.580
And you can't go wrong there.

01:29.810 --> 01:32.850
Even if your answer is wrong no one is going to kill you.

01:32.870 --> 01:39.380
Instead you're going to learn if people correct you and answering forces you to think about a problem

01:39.440 --> 01:40.820
and find a solution.

01:40.850 --> 01:47.630
If you really want to become a great re-act developer you have to solve problems and answering the Q

01:47.630 --> 01:55.150
and A section is a good way of practicing just that and finally practice practice practice.

01:55.160 --> 01:56.540
It's as easy as that.

01:56.630 --> 02:00.390
Even after you've finished this course you've got to practice the things you've learned.

02:00.530 --> 02:07.850
You have to build your own demo projects set your own challenges Dudi exercises from this course alter

02:07.940 --> 02:11.630
the code you'll learn in this course practice react.

02:11.900 --> 02:17.900
If you follow these steps and follow through this entire course you'll be an awesome re-act developer

02:18.320 --> 02:20.410
and you'll be able to apply for chops.

02:20.420 --> 02:23.850
Become a re-act freelancer whatever you want with dad.

02:24.020 --> 02:27.520
Let's dive into react and learn how it works.
