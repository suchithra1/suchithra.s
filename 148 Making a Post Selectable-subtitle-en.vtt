00:02.010 --> 00:09.620
Now you'll learn the basics about sending requests in our example here with the help of years and using

00:09.620 --> 00:15.500
that data let's move on and let's not see how we can make sure that we can click on one of these posts

00:15.860 --> 00:20.900
and then load the post stated there so fetched the data for de-selected post.

00:20.960 --> 00:26.850
When we selected it for this of course mean to make sure that we can click our and single posts here.

00:27.080 --> 00:33.440
So in the post component of first of all add a listener to the whole article aliment and there I expect

00:33.440 --> 00:39.070
to get a property which holds a reference to the method which should be executed upon a click.

00:39.260 --> 00:43.730
So here I'll name the prop collect in the block container.

00:43.730 --> 00:49.880
I now need to pass dead click prop queue to post and I'll just split it over multiple lines to make

00:49.880 --> 00:56.930
it a bit easier to read and clicked here as I've just said should hold that method reference which should

00:56.930 --> 00:59.130
get executed on a click.

00:59.150 --> 01:03.780
So we have a class based container here let's add such a method.

01:03.920 --> 01:12.450
The Post clicked or maybe post selected handler and there I expect to get an argument.

01:12.530 --> 01:20.440
The idea of the post which was selected now down there where we rendered a list of posts I can pass

01:20.510 --> 01:27.620
and E-6 function arrow function as a reference which should be executed when we click on a post and

01:27.620 --> 01:31.470
they don't want to execute the post select that handler.

01:31.640 --> 01:35.920
But now I can pass post ID as an argument to that method.

01:36.110 --> 01:42.830
So now I got an idea to work with now that ID should be passed to the full post component.

01:43.070 --> 01:51.260
So we should probably store it in the state on maybe selected post property like this state selected

01:51.260 --> 01:59.990
post ID so that inside full post we can listen to us getting a new ID and that fetched they afforded

02:00.010 --> 02:01.170
ID.

02:01.220 --> 02:08.280
So now we need to create debt selected posts id property in the state of the block container and then

02:08.360 --> 02:17.060
their posts like that handler we can call this set state and set the selected post ID to the ID we received

02:17.090 --> 02:18.640
as an argument here.

02:18.650 --> 02:21.810
So now were passing that ID to the full post component.

02:23.000 --> 02:27.010
And maybe you should also define Selecta post ID to be an initial.

02:27.010 --> 02:29.430
Now maybe here on the state.

02:29.780 --> 02:31.640
So now we added that code.

02:31.640 --> 02:36.530
Now we have to go to the full post component and do something with the idea here.

02:36.710 --> 02:40.870
Now there first of all we can use the ID to output either.

02:40.880 --> 02:47.410
Please select the post or de-selected post depending on whether we have an ID or not.

02:47.420 --> 02:52.850
So lets say the default should be 3 3C please select the post and I'll add some inline styling here

02:52.850 --> 02:57.270
to centredness by simply setting text align to center.

02:57.860 --> 03:02.380
And now I want to check if this prompts ID.

03:02.600 --> 03:11.210
If this is true ish initially ID in the block container is null and we're passing this to full post

03:11.570 --> 03:13.700
and NULL is treated as false.

03:13.700 --> 03:16.400
So initially it does check here.

03:16.550 --> 03:21.070
Will return false so we won't get inside the if block.

03:21.350 --> 03:28.480
If we do get inside which we only do once the ID is something which is not treated as false.

03:28.520 --> 03:35.540
So something above 1 or equal to or higher than 1 and all the IDs we get from the server are equal to

03:35.540 --> 03:36.910
or higher than 1.

03:37.040 --> 03:40.100
Once this is the case I want to output that post.

03:40.280 --> 03:45.970
So now we should have the following behavior that if I saved this we now can click on one of these posts.

03:46.190 --> 03:47.580
And now we see it.

03:47.690 --> 03:51.760
And as you saw before I clicked it we see police select post.

03:51.980 --> 03:52.920
So that's working.

03:52.940 --> 03:58.070
Now in the next lecture let's make sure that we also fetched the data for that given post.

03:58.190 --> 03:59.330
Once we selected it.
