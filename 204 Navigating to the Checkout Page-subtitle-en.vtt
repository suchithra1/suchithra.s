The last lecture I set up routeing no one to prove this and I want to make sure that when I click on

00:08.230 --> 00:16.240
continue in that mode here on the order summary that I actually load a different route.

00:16.570 --> 00:21.220
Now it's the chase continued hÃ¤ndler a year which is interesting.

00:21.290 --> 00:25.630
Dad is the handler which gets fired when I click continue.

00:25.630 --> 00:33.170
Right now this is where I said loading to true and where I then placed my order and send it to the web.

00:33.310 --> 00:39.340
I will comment all this code out because I no longer want to store it on firebase immediately here.

00:39.490 --> 00:42.920
I went to go to the check out component instead.

00:42.940 --> 00:51.490
Now as you learned since Burgard Boulder is part of their route to all areas of our project we have

00:51.490 --> 00:55.500
access to the match location and history props.

00:55.510 --> 01:01.950
I can prove this by adding Konsole lock this props in component.

01:02.010 --> 01:03.920
MT We have a look.

01:03.940 --> 01:08.040
We see the problem with history location and match.

01:08.150 --> 01:16.930
Now by the way since in here we also use a couple of components like the broken component just in case

01:16.930 --> 01:21.010
you're wondering do we also have access to these props here.

01:21.280 --> 01:27.160
Let's simply lock props in the Bergere function in the Bergere component.

01:27.160 --> 01:30.110
There you see we only have two ingredients.

01:30.220 --> 01:35.840
We don't have access to match and so on there because while this is of course part of the Roudebush

01:35.890 --> 01:44.720
area burger is not loaded through a route object only burger burglarious burger Bolar is loaded for

01:44.770 --> 01:50.830
this route and everything which is loaded for a route but only the direct components are only Burgard

01:50.830 --> 01:56.990
Boulder itself gets these special props components nested inside Bergrin builder.

01:57.040 --> 02:00.720
Don't get them we would have to pass them on manually.

02:00.730 --> 02:08.830
There is a way we could still get the props in the burger component too though and this really is a

02:08.830 --> 02:11.940
bit advanced and not something we need here.

02:11.950 --> 02:14.380
But I want to show it nonetheless.

02:14.380 --> 02:19.600
Let me reintroduce that lock statement to see the problem and we saw that we don't have the match and

02:19.600 --> 02:21.000
history thing.

02:21.340 --> 02:31.570
If we use a special higher order component provided by re-act router Dom we can actually kind of inject

02:32.350 --> 02:38.410
or make them available inject these special props in any component.

02:38.800 --> 02:47.230
The higher order component is named with router and if we wrap our export with it so like this with

02:47.230 --> 02:51.440
router Bergere here I now save this.

02:51.580 --> 02:59.140
Now you see that in the router We also have match location and history and matchable referred to the

02:59.230 --> 03:07.090
nearest match so to the nearest route which was matched in the past in this case the route which matched

03:07.150 --> 03:11.750
the Bergere bolder it does is something I also wanted to share with you.

03:11.770 --> 03:14.870
We will use it later again when we really need it.

03:14.890 --> 03:16.630
Just want to show this little trick.

03:16.750 --> 03:24.190
If you ever need direct access to match history on any location and you don't want to manually pass

03:24.190 --> 03:28.760
it on from the top level component you can use with router.

03:28.900 --> 03:31.610
I did mention this in the routing section already.

03:31.810 --> 03:40.990
Well back to our original task in the Bergere Boulder component in the method which gets executed when

03:40.990 --> 03:43.140
we click continue there.

03:43.150 --> 03:45.910
I of course had access to this props.

03:45.910 --> 03:49.380
History is one of these special props provided by the router.

03:49.480 --> 03:55.240
And there we have this push prop which allows us to basically switch to page portion you page onto that

03:55.240 --> 03:57.450
stack of pages.

03:57.460 --> 04:03.210
So now here I can simply say that I want to go to slash checkout.

04:03.430 --> 04:09.880
If we save this let's see what happens if I start pulling my Bergere here and I click order now and

04:09.880 --> 04:11.530
click continue.

04:11.530 --> 04:13.360
Now I'm on the checkout page.

04:13.360 --> 04:16.520
I get an error because the listeners aren't hooked up yet.

04:16.690 --> 04:20.800
But besides that it's working now a won't connect.

04:20.800 --> 04:27.010
Just check out the navigation link here because I'm going to replace it with my order slings soon anyways

04:27.550 --> 04:34.570
so that's something I won't do here but the next step I want to do is let's add more functionality so

04:34.570 --> 04:38.710
that when we click Cancel here we actually are taken back.

04:38.710 --> 04:45.940
We go back to the Berggruen Boulder whilst when clicking continue we show up for him where we can enter

04:45.940 --> 04:46.920
some data.

04:47.110 --> 04:48.810
This is what I want to build next.
