00:02.230 --> 00:07.860
So we got working routeing we got information about the props we received from re-act router.

00:08.080 --> 00:14.530
Wouldn't it also be nice to see which route is active year by styling it appropriately.

00:14.530 --> 00:21.640
We kind of want to add a special C-s S-Class to the link which is active so that we can use that class

00:21.640 --> 00:23.300
to change the styling.

00:23.620 --> 00:29.450
Right now if we inspect that here you'll see it is a longer tag which was created behind the scenes.

00:29.470 --> 00:35.980
But again anchor tag managed by the re-act router preventing the default which would be to really send

00:36.010 --> 00:37.220
that request.

00:37.450 --> 00:41.670
But you also see that there is no class being added to it.

00:41.680 --> 00:46.210
Even though that technically right now is still active page.

00:46.210 --> 00:52.930
So what we have to do is we manually have to tell re-act router to do so and we do this by not using

00:52.930 --> 00:56.310
a link but a different type of link.

00:56.520 --> 00:59.090
The naphthalene component.

00:59.380 --> 01:06.760
It's pretty similar to link but it has some extra props which allow us to define some styling for the

01:06.760 --> 01:12.060
act of link let's replace link with Naphtol.

01:12.460 --> 01:15.880
And make sure to imported it as I just did.

01:15.880 --> 01:23.170
Now if you go back to the application you see re-inspected element which is a link here at the top for

01:23.170 --> 01:27.160
the active route which is new you post in my case has changed.

01:27.160 --> 01:29.700
There is a active class added.

01:29.700 --> 01:36.640
Now this is as class wasn't present before it does of course now allows us to apply some styling.

01:36.700 --> 01:45.640
So in Block C Ss I can simply add a new rule and not only change to link color to orange if we're hovering

01:45.640 --> 01:50.720
over it or clicking on it but all to for all links which have the active class.

01:50.890 --> 01:56.260
If we save this now Actually both are orange.

01:56.260 --> 02:03.020
If I click on home though only home is orange Why is that the reason for this is something we learned

02:03.020 --> 02:11.390
about earlier by default re-act router treats Steese Pasir as prefixes and the same is true for links

02:11.750 --> 02:14.200
when checking whether a link is active or not.

02:14.210 --> 02:16.440
It treats this as a prefix.

02:16.550 --> 02:25.250
So we have to add exact year just as on the route to tell re-act router No the full pop should be does.

02:25.400 --> 02:27.840
For this to be the active link.

02:28.130 --> 02:31.030
So this doesn't change the link we're pointing to.

02:31.100 --> 02:37.380
It will always be the pathway to fine but for the active class it would take this as a prefix.

02:37.520 --> 02:39.250
We override that with Access.

02:39.380 --> 02:45.980
Now the full payoff has to be slash for days to receive this active C Ss class.

02:46.280 --> 02:52.550
So with expect added to the first link it's not needed for the second because there we don't really

02:52.550 --> 02:57.590
have any nested links which should not trigger the active class here.

02:57.950 --> 03:00.560
So exact added for the first link.

03:00.560 --> 03:03.490
Now we have the Home link still being highlighted.

03:03.500 --> 03:09.930
If we are on the root page but if they click on new post only new post is highlighted now.

03:09.980 --> 03:13.030
So this is how we can set up active classes.

03:13.260 --> 03:20.360
Now sometimes you don't want to use debt default of active as an active class name.

03:20.390 --> 03:25.890
Maybe you want to use my Dasch active or highlight or whatever you want.

03:26.060 --> 03:29.960
That's why you can override the class which should be appended.

03:30.260 --> 03:35.660
You can add additional props and I'm just splitting this over multiple lines to make it easy to read.

03:35.990 --> 03:42.020
You can add active class name and set this to a string.

03:42.260 --> 03:46.620
And this could now be my active and now for you firstling.

03:46.880 --> 03:53.370
My active will be added as an active C S S class and not the default of active.

03:53.390 --> 03:55.630
So now you see if we reload.

03:55.680 --> 04:00.880
Gnuplot was still installed because it still has the act of class because there I didn't change anything

04:01.370 --> 04:07.700
but home now doesn't receive the active styling because as you can see if we expect that on the right

04:07.970 --> 04:13.330
it has a C S S Class of my active because that is what we set up here.

04:13.370 --> 04:19.670
Active class name my active now switches to active which is redundant because that's the default anyways

04:19.790 --> 04:23.980
but just to leave it here for reference that you can set this up.

04:24.020 --> 04:28.820
You also don't have to work with CSSA classes if you don't want to.

04:28.820 --> 04:31.870
You can also set the active style instead.

04:32.180 --> 04:36.730
So let's turn this back to my active which wouldn't apply any styling.

04:37.010 --> 04:40.150
And let's instead said active style here.

04:40.450 --> 04:42.300
This is a dynamic value.

04:42.440 --> 04:47.880
It's a javascript object and it actually works just like you use inline styling.

04:47.900 --> 04:57.200
Here you can set up any C-s as styles like maybe color and set this to f a 9 to free f which is the

04:57.200 --> 05:03.400
color we use and C S s too but that's all the set text decoration to underline.

05:03.410 --> 05:08.600
Now if we save this and go back to the app you'll see homeless orange and underlined.

05:08.930 --> 05:17.040
Whereas new post is just orange because new post uses this active C S S class home.

05:17.060 --> 05:22.080
However when being active receives my act of class which does nothing.

05:22.280 --> 05:26.140
But then also receive some inline styling inline styling.

05:26.140 --> 05:32.410
We set up with active style so this is how you can style the act of pollings.

05:32.420 --> 05:39.740
The key takeaway is you have to use to naff link object not the regular link object and you might need

05:39.740 --> 05:46.700
to use except to make sure you only style the links for the routes you want to style and you don't use

05:46.700 --> 05:53.400
the two part here as a prefix when it comes to determining whether a route is active or not.
