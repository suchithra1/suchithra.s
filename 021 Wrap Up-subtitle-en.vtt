00:01.980 --> 00:07.780
With that I want to conclude this Marchal we've learned a lot about next generation javascript and some

00:07.780 --> 00:09.580
important javascript concepts.

00:09.580 --> 00:15.430
In general you will meet a lot of the things you'll learn about in this module throughout the course.

00:15.460 --> 00:16.790
Don't be confused by it.

00:16.840 --> 00:18.330
It's still javascript.

00:18.490 --> 00:21.070
Just using some more modern features.

00:21.070 --> 00:23.740
That's just how we write re-act apps.

00:23.890 --> 00:26.760
The next module will now start with free act.

00:26.770 --> 00:32.300
Now I will show you how to quickly create a project set up where we can use all these features while

00:32.340 --> 00:36.360
still shipping code that works in older browsers too.

00:36.440 --> 00:38.200
With that you're well-prepared.

00:38.200 --> 00:43.660
Always feel free to go back to this marshal and have a look at a given feature if you forgot how it

00:43.660 --> 00:47.640
worked and you meet it in the course and want to refresh your knowledge.

00:47.710 --> 00:50.080
And with that let's dive into re-act.
