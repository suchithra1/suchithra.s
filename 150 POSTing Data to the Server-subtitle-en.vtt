So over the last lectures I show you a lot how you can get data.

00:06.520 --> 00:12.450
Now of course I also want to show you how you can post data to a server and for Debbie get the ad a

00:12.510 --> 00:15.290
post area here at the bottom.

00:15.370 --> 00:21.070
It's managed by the new post component which is a class based component which manages its own state

00:21.340 --> 00:27.020
and hence is a container because we're not passing or distributing the state to any other components.

00:27.100 --> 00:33.230
And now I want to hook up this ad post button to essentially send a POST request to our Dammy backend

00:33.740 --> 00:34.640
for this.

00:34.660 --> 00:42.290
First of all add a Meffert the post data handler or post post handler if you want to do it.

00:42.300 --> 00:45.330
And then there of course I need to use x yes.

00:45.340 --> 00:53.260
Now first of all let's hope this method up by adding the on click listener down there this postdate

00:53.270 --> 00:54.330
a handler.

00:54.670 --> 01:00.180
And now let's import years so we can send a post request.

01:00.550 --> 01:02.290
Now say think post requests.

01:02.310 --> 01:04.180
Still use the axes object.

01:04.320 --> 01:08.440
But now of course not the get method but the post method.

01:08.700 --> 01:15.360
The post if it still takes a u r l as an input and for our dummy back end we can simply use the same

01:15.480 --> 01:21.090
or else we used for the get request it also accepts post requests.

01:21.120 --> 01:27.390
Now a post request needs more than you are Eldo it needs a second argument which is that data we want

01:27.390 --> 01:32.850
to send because obviously a post request without data does make that much sense.

01:32.850 --> 01:39.930
The data I want to send is a javascript object which contains title body an offer of a post.

01:39.930 --> 01:45.900
So I'll create a new constant which should be a javascript object and there will set up a title to this

01:46.140 --> 01:47.940
state title.

01:48.020 --> 01:55.290
I'll set the body to this state content and you can of course choose any properties you want for that

01:55.290 --> 02:00.980
object and I will set the offer to this state of offer.

02:00.990 --> 02:02.450
Again you can add more.

02:02.520 --> 02:06.500
You can expand this form here at the bottom of course.

02:06.660 --> 02:13.230
Then I will said post this constant your second argument to the post method.

02:13.470 --> 02:18.840
And of course this is just called post because what resubmitting is some data about a post you can name

02:18.840 --> 02:20.080
does what ever you want.

02:20.100 --> 02:22.360
You can also named as data.

02:22.860 --> 02:27.120
Now you can also pass a third argument to configure this request but we don't need that.

02:27.120 --> 02:29.500
You're important for us.

02:29.550 --> 02:35.460
This of course is a javascript object but Access will automatically basically string you fighters so

02:35.460 --> 02:37.160
turned us into Jason data.

02:37.170 --> 02:43.200
It will do it for us just as it extract the adjacent data and get requests for us too.

02:43.680 --> 02:46.820
And now does all of course runs asynchronously.

02:46.860 --> 02:54.210
We can listen to the response just like we can do it for get requests and we can present it to the console

02:54.210 --> 02:55.290
here.

02:55.290 --> 02:56.480
Now let's try this out.

02:56.480 --> 02:57.680
Let's save this.

02:57.900 --> 03:03.570
Let's open the console and let's enter some content here.

03:03.580 --> 03:09.670
Does some test content maybe switch you offer to menu and hit ad post.

03:10.020 --> 03:18.000
And here's the response status text 201 which indicates that it was successful and now that dummy back

03:18.000 --> 03:24.540
into here won't store the data of course it just returns the data in the response so that we can see

03:24.540 --> 03:27.880
that we did send it successfully and looks like we did.

03:27.910 --> 03:28.620
Does this to date.

03:28.620 --> 03:32.640
We did send again for a real server of course for your own server.

03:32.640 --> 03:38.430
You probably have some logic on the server to dentals the stored is in the database.

03:38.430 --> 03:44.250
This is how we can post data that is all that's do it just exchanging the word here the name of the

03:44.250 --> 03:47.460
method and passing the data as a second argument.

03:47.610 --> 03:50.350
And now we can also send data to servers.
