00:02.340 --> 00:07.460
So we already got our hands dirty and we saw how we Bulgar react.

00:07.970 --> 00:12.620
Now does all the answers about why we might want to use react.

00:12.630 --> 00:13.730
There's also more.

00:13.730 --> 00:20.760
There are more reasons why we want to use re-act react helps us with a problem will encounter with normal

00:20.760 --> 00:28.900
javascript DUI state becomes difficult to manage in bigger javascript applications.

00:28.980 --> 00:34.520
You have to manually target elements in your dom and if you don't change the structure of your age Jammal

00:34.530 --> 00:41.470
code chances are you need to change the way you target your elements because you used Cuore selector.

00:41.580 --> 00:47.610
Or even if you used Shakeri traversing the dorm is easier but it's still always something you have to

00:47.610 --> 00:48.590
keep in mind.

00:48.730 --> 00:55.020
And if you got more complex web apps where you dynamically add and remove elements this quickly can

00:55.020 --> 01:02.640
become cumbersome in our courts project we bowled AB which is highly dynamic where we are able to build

01:02.640 --> 01:06.000
a burger and dynamically add or remove ingredients.

01:06.180 --> 01:10.040
If you write this with normal javascript code it's going to be a nightmare.

01:10.140 --> 01:16.370
So re-act helps us by making the whole UI state management a non issue.

01:16.410 --> 01:21.440
It allows us to focus on our business logic instead of keeping our application from exploding.

01:21.540 --> 01:26.400
And additionally re-act is maintained by a big community.

01:26.400 --> 01:31.510
So chances are the react code is written better than we could have ever written it.

01:31.740 --> 01:34.480
So therefore it's highly efficient and fast.

01:34.560 --> 01:38.850
And the bigger your application gets the more this matters too.

01:38.850 --> 01:45.370
And finally re-act features a huge eco system and an extremely active community which means that there

01:45.370 --> 01:51.210
is a great chance that for a given problem you face you'll find a solution or an extra packet you can

01:51.210 --> 01:52.770
add to fix it.

01:52.770 --> 01:57.960
All these are reasons why re-act is awesome and why you definitely should consider it for your next

01:57.960 --> 02:01.440
project and why you made the right choice to start with this course.
