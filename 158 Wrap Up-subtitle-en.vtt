00:02.160 --> 00:07.920
So in this module we learn a lot about sending aid to the requests from re-act you learn that it works

00:07.920 --> 00:13.650
by sending Ajax requests and that it's best to use a package like X years for X use who learned how

00:13.650 --> 00:20.700
it worked and that you can set some default configuration at address centers or even split the configuration

00:20.700 --> 00:22.790
with custom instances.

00:22.800 --> 00:29.440
Now of course practicing always is the best thing you can do to get comfortable using a certain tool.

00:29.670 --> 00:36.730
And that is why in the next module we will also add some HTP functionality to our Bergere bowler so

00:36.750 --> 00:43.200
that when we click that order button we really send the request to our server to at least fake that

00:43.200 --> 00:44.660
we really placed the order.
