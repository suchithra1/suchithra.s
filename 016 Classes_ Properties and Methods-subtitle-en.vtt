00:02.150 --> 00:06.750
So in the last year we learned about classes and we learn about properties and methods.

00:06.770 --> 00:14.670
Q Now next generation javascript also offers a different syntax of initializing properties and methods.

00:14.830 --> 00:19.120
And actually it is this more modern syntax all use underscores.

00:19.160 --> 00:21.280
So I want to show it to you here too.

00:21.530 --> 00:27.170
You already learnt that properties are like variables you attach to classes and objects methods are

00:27.170 --> 00:34.070
like functions attached to classes and objects and you'll learn about this syntax where we set up properties

00:34.070 --> 00:35.750
in the constructor function.

00:35.750 --> 00:43.400
Now there is a more modern syntax which spares us using this constructor function with next generation

00:43.400 --> 00:46.380
javascript as we will use it in this course.

00:46.490 --> 00:52.880
You can assign a property directly inside your class with my property equals value.

00:52.880 --> 00:55.680
So you skipped the constructor function call.

00:55.850 --> 00:59.270
Behind the scenes this will still be transformed to use constructor functions.

00:59.330 --> 01:04.010
But you have an easier time writing this and form effets is pretty similar.

01:04.010 --> 01:05.140
This is the old way.

01:05.150 --> 01:07.070
I'll show you in the last lecture.

01:07.310 --> 01:13.880
Now the next generation javascript way is to use the syntax from the left where you set up a property

01:14.270 --> 01:20.930
and simply think of a method as a property which stores a function as a value and then you end up with

01:20.930 --> 01:21.580
that.

01:21.770 --> 01:26.030
My method equals and then an arrow function.

01:26.030 --> 01:32.950
The great advantage of this syntax is that since he was an arrow function as a property value here you've

01:32.960 --> 01:39.350
got no problems with this keyword and that's the exact reason why we will use this syntax here on the

01:39.350 --> 01:44.080
bottom right corner and the syntax on the bottom left corner for this course.

01:44.150 --> 01:46.240
Let me show you the syntax to you.

01:47.040 --> 01:52.330
Back to J s been on the project we already worked on here with the human and the person class.

01:52.440 --> 01:57.310
We can't get rid of the constructor in the human class and get rid of the this keyword.

01:57.320 --> 02:00.890
Just set gender equal to male and print.

02:00.900 --> 02:06.450
Gender can be set equal to an arrow function where we Kohn's a log.

02:06.450 --> 02:11.430
This gender still using this keyword in here when we reach out to the property.

02:11.440 --> 02:17.610
Though you may ignore that arrow for now the same and the person will no longer need the constructor

02:17.700 --> 02:20.860
and we no longer need to call super for that reason.

02:20.880 --> 02:27.750
Instead what we do is we call this name without this just name equal to Max and gender equal female

02:27.760 --> 02:35.840
if you want to and print my name equals an arrow function to like this.

02:35.840 --> 02:41.330
Now if the cleaner does doesn't run this you will get an error because it doesn't recognize to Sendak's

02:41.660 --> 02:46.600
you actually need to go to the dropdown where it says javascript and choose it as.

02:46.700 --> 02:47.920
Babble here.

02:48.260 --> 02:52.230
If you do this and hit clear and run you'll see Max and female.

02:52.250 --> 02:55.490
You'll still see the arrows on the left but you may ignore them.

02:55.490 --> 03:01.490
This is the syntax which is next generation javascript which we will actually use in this course.
