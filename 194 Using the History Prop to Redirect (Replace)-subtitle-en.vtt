In the last lecture we learn how to conditionally redirect.

00:05.480 --> 00:12.020
And that is a nice way of redirecting now to be honest the way we redirect in the new post component

00:12.410 --> 00:19.560
is maybe not the way you're always going to do that in the end after submitting a post successfully.

00:19.700 --> 00:26.090
You just want to switch to page and for Dad you can of course also use that history Propp which you

00:26.090 --> 00:35.240
get on every component which is loaded inside a browser or router wrapped component and your post is

00:35.250 --> 00:36.680
in the end loaded for block.

00:36.680 --> 00:43.280
So therefore it is wrap by browser router in there we have access to that match location and history

00:43.310 --> 00:45.070
prob I showed you earlier.

00:45.380 --> 00:51.260
And that history prob has a couple of convenience methods we can use for replacing the current route

00:51.350 --> 00:53.170
or pushing a new route.

00:53.540 --> 01:02.330
So we can also change the page here without changing the state and therefore by never rendering that

01:02.390 --> 01:09.740
redirect component but instead by accessing disk prop's history and there the push method which allows

01:09.740 --> 01:11.330
us to portion you page.

01:11.330 --> 01:18.130
So here we could all go to slash posts and this will essentially lead to the same behavior as before

01:18.710 --> 01:20.570
we can go to new posts.

01:20.750 --> 01:27.780
We can enter a new post and once it is done we push a new page and we are redirected technically.

01:27.890 --> 01:30.850
Porsche pushes this page onto the stack.

01:30.950 --> 01:37.670
So if you click the backpack open we go back to the new post page where as redirect replaces current

01:37.670 --> 01:38.290
page.

01:38.390 --> 01:42.700
So if we then click the back button and you can of course try this out after you comment this.

01:42.710 --> 01:48.330
And again if you click the back button often redirecting and not by pushing.

01:48.650 --> 01:54.830
You can go back but you won't go back to the last page because redirect replaces the current page on

01:54.830 --> 02:00.290
the stack it doesn't push a new one though you can also replicate this behavior by not using Porsche

02:00.620 --> 02:04.750
but replace your on the history object if you use data.

02:04.760 --> 02:08.350
You go to new post if you now enter something here.

02:08.510 --> 02:12.320
We also leave the page but now press the back button.

02:12.470 --> 02:19.940
We're still on post because we were there before we visit new post because new post was replaced on

02:19.940 --> 02:21.460
a stack of pages.

02:21.770 --> 02:27.650
So replace basically does the same as redirecting and therefore you can use it as an alternative.

02:27.680 --> 02:32.780
I wanted to show you both methods though because maybe you have a use case where you want to render

02:32.780 --> 02:35.070
that redirect component conditionally.

02:35.150 --> 02:37.720
And then this is an easy way of doing it.

02:37.910 --> 02:44.360
If you don't want to use the approach of rendering the component replace or Porsche or there's a way

02:44.450 --> 02:47.630
of changing the page after some operation finished.
