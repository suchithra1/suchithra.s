00:02.120 --> 00:03.680
So let's implement this.

00:03.680 --> 00:11.210
Check out component are actually implemented it is a container because it will be a component which

00:11.210 --> 00:16.590
manages its own state and also passes this down to Avro components.

00:16.640 --> 00:22.690
So add a new folder in containers and I'll name it checkout and in there I'll add that check out.

00:22.730 --> 00:27.010
JS file which well should hold my check out component.

00:27.080 --> 00:34.190
It'll be a class based components and state will be involved and therefore I extend the component object

00:34.190 --> 00:42.380
which I have to import from react to Gabr with the re-act package itself to support as X..

00:42.680 --> 00:45.610
So let's add this class.

00:45.830 --> 00:53.720
Let's then export it as a default office file and then let's plan how does it check out component shoat

00:53.810 --> 00:56.000
look like it should behave.

00:56.000 --> 01:02.970
What I want to have in the checkout component is a tiny summary of the checkout.

01:03.020 --> 01:10.290
So basically what the user is about to buy and the price probably and then a button to cancel the checkout

01:10.310 --> 01:15.460
process and go back to the Bergere Boulder and of course a button to continue.

01:15.680 --> 01:22.580
And I guess for the summary it would be nice to not again show just a list of the ingredients but maybe

01:22.580 --> 01:24.210
show the burger itself.

01:24.230 --> 01:26.060
Rebuild the burger in this.

01:26.060 --> 01:27.850
Check out summary.

01:27.950 --> 01:30.760
So that's the goal here Chaudiere summary.

01:30.830 --> 01:36.700
And then when the user clicks on continue I don't want to load the contact form.

01:37.040 --> 01:44.780
So step by step the goal therefore is to create a checkout summary form which allows me to display a

01:44.780 --> 01:52.280
preview of the burger and showed you continue or Cancel buttons for that all go into my components folder

01:52.370 --> 01:55.340
and add a new folder in there.

01:55.340 --> 01:56.530
What's your name.

01:56.660 --> 02:05.770
Check out or maybe order to place all order related components there like to check out component check

02:05.780 --> 02:05.960
out.

02:05.960 --> 02:07.740
It should be named.

02:07.820 --> 02:09.980
Check out summary maybe.

02:10.130 --> 02:13.270
And then there to create a check out summary.

02:13.330 --> 02:14.840
J.S. fall into.

02:15.020 --> 02:20.310
Check out summary CSSA fall for the styling.

02:20.540 --> 02:27.440
Now let's have a look at the check out summary dodgiest fall they're all used to functional form to

02:27.440 --> 02:29.950
create the check out summary component.

02:29.990 --> 02:33.580
So basically just check out Samari function here as you know it.

02:33.700 --> 02:39.630
We will probably receive some props to render the burger and then return some GSX.

02:39.680 --> 02:44.810
So therefore we definitely need to import re-act from the Riak package.

02:45.020 --> 02:47.260
And of course it always export.

02:47.270 --> 02:50.150
Check out summary as the default.

02:50.150 --> 03:00.180
Now the goal is to display a preview of all or burger year and then show continue or Cancel buttons.

03:00.200 --> 03:09.500
So what I'll do is in the J is X which I want to return here all first of all Raptor's in a div which

03:09.500 --> 03:14.900
I'll also use for styling purposes to give discommode in some style.

03:14.900 --> 03:19.640
Then I want to have each one tag where I say we hope it tastes well.

03:19.640 --> 03:22.940
Something like that and their offer.

03:22.960 --> 03:29.420
Now I want to have a box in a div basically where I want to preview my Bergere component.

03:29.620 --> 03:33.650
Does Davis require to set the boundaries of that Bergere component.

03:33.650 --> 03:37.240
And of course I'm going to reuse my Bergere component which I already have.

03:37.250 --> 03:38.180
That's that cool thing.

03:38.180 --> 03:45.590
We can reuse it so I'll set some inline styling here on that wrapping div which will hold my burger

03:46.040 --> 03:55.420
just to set the width of that save 300 pixels and then also our height of let's say 300 pixels and let's

03:55.430 --> 04:00.180
then also set the margin to auto here.

04:00.180 --> 04:06.970
Now inside that div I want to use my burger components only to import it all import Bergere from and

04:06.970 --> 04:11.620
now navigate up into the Bergere folder and there is Steve J as file.

04:11.650 --> 04:15.730
Does hour Bergere component which I can now conveniently add like this.

04:15.740 --> 04:17.790
The burger a self-closing tag.

04:18.440 --> 04:24.050
I there also need to pass my ingredients for dad.

04:24.050 --> 04:29.740
It will of course be important to know how I received these ingredients.

04:29.750 --> 04:37.220
I assume that for now I can simply just set the ingredients property of my burger component which it

04:37.280 --> 04:40.080
does expect if we have a look at the burger component.

04:40.220 --> 04:47.060
We have prop's ingredients in there which we use so I should ALL the past is today's ingredient at Tudor's

04:47.240 --> 04:48.380
component.

04:48.440 --> 04:50.670
Perhaps not or do a summary check out summary.

04:50.690 --> 04:51.630
Here we are.

04:51.920 --> 04:58.460
So we expect the ingredients in the burger so we should pass it and for now just expect that in the

04:58.460 --> 04:59.970
checkout summary component.

05:00.050 --> 05:08.450
I'll also get ingredients property which I then just pass on below that I don't want to show my buttons

05:08.480 --> 05:16.160
and afford it all import my own buttons I built so that button component from the UI folder and there

05:16.160 --> 05:24.130
from the button folder and then the button just fall of course and DS buttons as you probably know support

05:24.170 --> 05:25.640
two different styles.

05:25.640 --> 05:31.850
We have success and the danger class here which we can't pass and we do pass it with the button type

05:31.850 --> 05:33.200
properties.

05:33.500 --> 05:35.900
So I'll add my buttons below.

05:35.900 --> 05:38.210
There are at the first button.

05:38.210 --> 05:39.890
Where else at the button type.

05:40.430 --> 05:48.260
Let's say danger with a capital D because the FCC has a class name where R is simply want to say cancel.

05:48.260 --> 05:55.850
Maybe all caps for stalling purposes only and then are duplicated to all the have is access button with

05:55.850 --> 06:00.210
a capital S where I will have say continue.

06:00.230 --> 06:01.800
So these are the two buttons.

06:01.880 --> 06:08.510
You also know that the buttons expose the click property which simply indicates that we clicked on the

06:08.510 --> 06:11.910
button so that is something I'll all need to do.

06:12.020 --> 06:14.210
Let's split this over multiple lines.

06:14.240 --> 06:18.460
Implement clicked here and then do something up on a click.

06:18.500 --> 06:23.810
Now that is something I will add for now I just want to finish the styling of this component.

06:23.810 --> 06:29.970
So with that we got our check out summary JSA X code.

06:29.990 --> 06:36.820
Now let me also assign a class name to the wrapping div and this is a class I want to set up and check

06:36.820 --> 06:42.900
out summary sucessful all at check out summary see business class here.

06:42.950 --> 06:50.290
Because remember we're back in our course project we're using CSSA modules here to scope our styles.

06:50.330 --> 06:57.080
They're all set text aligned to center to center everything or set the width to 80 percent maybe and

06:57.080 --> 07:01.440
a margin of auto 2 then Center does div or does element.

07:01.760 --> 07:08.300
And I'll add a media query where a check if we have a minimum with of 600 pixels at which point of time

07:08.330 --> 07:13.110
I simply want to limit the width so that it's no longer a percent.

07:13.280 --> 07:16.730
But here I will limit it to 500 pixels.

07:16.730 --> 07:24.560
Now with that I have to import does see is as code or the classes object you should be precise from

07:24.560 --> 07:27.860
check out summary C S S and then assign it here.

07:27.860 --> 07:30.500
So here all add classes.

07:30.500 --> 07:32.050
Check out summary.

07:32.120 --> 07:35.190
Taking advantage of C S S modules here.

07:35.450 --> 07:38.280
Now we get to check out summary component.

07:38.300 --> 07:46.640
I know when to use stat in my check out file in my check out container to be precise so there will quickly

07:46.640 --> 07:54.170
import that check out the summary component we just created from the components folder.

07:54.170 --> 08:01.050
Therefore there I created that order folder which hold the check out summary folder and there the check

08:01.050 --> 08:03.690
out summary Ejay as file.

08:03.740 --> 08:11.070
Now inside my check out component where I'll implement a render method where I then of course returns

08:11.080 --> 08:17.270
I'm GSX there I want to have a div which wraps my entire page because this will be used as a page with

08:17.270 --> 08:21.940
the re-act router of course and they're all now at.

08:21.950 --> 08:24.340
Check out summary like this.

08:24.410 --> 08:25.250
Keep in mind.

08:25.280 --> 08:32.630
Check out summary expects to get ingredients as a prop so it should pass ingredients here and that of

08:32.630 --> 08:34.860
course is an interesting question.

08:34.880 --> 08:38.560
Where do I get my ingredients from.

08:38.560 --> 08:46.290
For now I'll simply pass a dummy ingredients object but of course this is something I will replace.

08:46.360 --> 08:54.210
I will add state to the checkout component and there in the state I'll add ingredients and ingredients

08:54.220 --> 09:01.700
for now will be salad one meat one cheese one and bacon one.

09:01.750 --> 09:05.430
And this again is just some dummy data which I'll replace.

09:05.440 --> 09:12.330
So for now that allows me to pass these state ingredients we will have to use routeing to repasts ingredients

09:12.340 --> 09:13.830
later.

09:13.840 --> 09:17.930
Now we get the check out summer and check out container here.

09:18.160 --> 09:26.170
I know want to use it of course and for that I will hard coded into my apt Cheras fall right below the

09:26.170 --> 09:27.540
Bergere Boulder.

09:27.760 --> 09:38.260
Here are import but check out container from dot slash containers check out checkout just to see how

09:38.260 --> 09:39.220
it looks.

09:39.430 --> 09:42.700
We will load and wire routing soon.

09:42.700 --> 09:49.630
Make sure to save all files and make sure NPM start is running and they're offer if you with your page.

09:49.630 --> 09:54.500
We get an error regarding the on click listener but that shouldn't be a problem right now.

09:54.520 --> 09:56.960
This is how it looks like our.

09:56.980 --> 09:59.360
Check out summary component.

09:59.590 --> 10:05.470
Now we can see that somehow does stave with the burger is not really centered so it is something we

10:05.470 --> 10:06.670
should fix.

10:06.700 --> 10:11.890
For that I'll go back to check out summary where I used the burger and one thing I should adjust here

10:11.890 --> 10:18.070
is that I should what use with 100 percent to take the full width of the check out summary component.

10:18.070 --> 10:25.080
Now with that that looks much better on both small devices and bigger devices now and small otherwise.

10:25.080 --> 10:29.050
Last year we got a little bit much height.

10:29.180 --> 10:32.020
Does this something we can fix by disabling this height.

10:32.050 --> 10:34.630
Not always setting it to free pixels.

10:34.750 --> 10:37.990
So let's just get rid of the hide property here.

10:38.120 --> 10:40.970
For the styling that was a little bit too much.

10:41.020 --> 10:47.020
Now we can definitely use that on mobile devices and on the desktop.

10:47.020 --> 10:47.870
This looks good.

10:47.880 --> 10:55.620
Q Now of course there is still some space but we need some space for bigger Burger's so does is to liberate

10:56.500 --> 11:02.830
but the main thing I now want to work on is that I don't always display this but instead this should

11:02.860 --> 11:03.770
be displayed.

11:03.880 --> 11:12.130
If I click on order now continue then I want to load to check out summary instead of the burger builder.

11:12.150 --> 11:15.430
Dats the goal and for data of course we need routing.

11:15.430 --> 11:22.510
Now feel free to go ahead and implement this on your own and then compare your solution with mine which

11:22.510 --> 11:24.790
I'll start building in the next lecture.
