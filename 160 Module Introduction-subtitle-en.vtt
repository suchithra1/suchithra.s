00:02.110 --> 00:07.510
So welcome back to our course project our Bergere Boulder now the Bergere Boulder is already pretty

00:07.510 --> 00:07.920
great.

00:07.930 --> 00:12.610
We can build burgers with it which doesn't sound too bad for this kind of application.

00:12.610 --> 00:15.000
Now we can continue to check out and read.

00:15.010 --> 00:19.240
Now when we click this nothing happens except for this alert.

00:19.240 --> 00:24.430
Now in the last module we learned how we can actually send HTP requests.

00:24.430 --> 00:28.680
So this sounds like a great opportunity to actually store that order.

00:28.730 --> 00:35.570
The customer customers about to place on a server now will then find you in his application later in

00:35.570 --> 00:40.840
the course once we know how to create different pages in our single page app and have for show a check

00:40.840 --> 00:42.280
out for them and so on.

00:42.490 --> 00:50.350
But for now storing the order and getting the orders that would be an amazing advancement in our application.

00:50.350 --> 00:57.340
So this is what this model is about will implement the backend so that we can actually store our orders

00:57.580 --> 00:59.580
so that we have a way of retrieving them.

00:59.710 --> 01:07.780
Even after our page was reloaded for that story on the back end I'm going to use firebase firebase is

01:07.780 --> 01:09.760
a service offered by Google.

01:09.970 --> 01:15.890
It's essentially out of the box working back and which includes a database.

01:15.910 --> 01:22.840
The cool thing is we can use it for free and for the amount of fuel we're going to apply in this course

01:22.840 --> 01:29.410
project it's going to stay free and we don't have to write any server side code which discours of course

01:29.440 --> 01:36.170
is not about but the way we communicate with firebase is the same we communicate with any other backend.

01:36.190 --> 01:40.220
So does is representative for your back and in your project.

01:40.390 --> 01:47.080
Now with that let's dive into that and let's create our fire best project in the next lecture so that

01:47.110 --> 01:50.150
we then can start storing our orders there.
