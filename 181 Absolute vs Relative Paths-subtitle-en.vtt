One more information about the links you set up here to slash to slash new post the way you write your

00:10.810 --> 00:11.890
links here.

00:11.980 --> 00:15.370
Doesn't the fact whether it's an absolute or relative path.

00:15.550 --> 00:18.930
Now what does absolute and relative mean anyways.

00:19.420 --> 00:23.310
An absolute payoff is always a pendant to your domain.

00:23.440 --> 00:29.720
So if you're serving this app from example dot com then you want to go to New post.

00:29.950 --> 00:37.360
If you navigate to slash new post that simply means always attach slash new post right after the domain.

00:37.420 --> 00:45.430
Even if you previously were an example that composts you wouldn't add new post at the end of that Tournay

00:45.440 --> 00:51.890
get it to post new post but turning it into exampled a new post and omitting posts.

00:52.140 --> 00:54.550
Is what an absolute paff does.

00:54.550 --> 01:00.260
Now when setting up two you can't control whether it's an absolute or relative POV.

01:00.340 --> 01:06.620
It's always treated as an absolute POV so no matter if it's slash new post or just new posts.

01:06.730 --> 01:11.420
It's an absolute POV and will always be appended to your root domain.

01:11.770 --> 01:15.990
Now what if you wanted to turn this into a relative part though.

01:16.000 --> 01:23.080
So if you wanted to make sure that if you are on your domain slash posts you actually go to your domain

01:23.080 --> 01:28.640
slash posts slash new posts so you append this to the end of the current path.

01:28.780 --> 01:35.650
Then you actually need to build this path dynamically by taking into advantage that you know at which

01:35.650 --> 01:37.810
POF you are currently on.

01:37.810 --> 01:41.230
Remember that you have access to this props match.

01:41.230 --> 01:48.620
We inspected this in the console the match object has d u r l object which is the currently loaded Hauf

01:48.630 --> 01:50.010
in the end.

01:50.020 --> 01:56.860
Now you can Shane slash new post to disk you can build a dynamic path like this.

01:56.860 --> 02:00.470
Now it's a relative one because it takes the page you're currently on.

02:00.490 --> 02:07.480
The payoff you're currently on and append stays at the end and all of a sudden you built a relative

02:07.480 --> 02:08.210
path.

02:08.530 --> 02:15.110
So if you ever want to build a link which simply appends the path to the end of the current path.

02:15.150 --> 02:16.730
Use this approach.

02:17.140 --> 02:21.650
Oberweis this always generates an absolute path.

02:21.700 --> 02:23.910
There is no better or worse here.

02:23.920 --> 02:30.060
It really depends on which behavior you want added to the root domain or appended to the current path.

02:30.070 --> 02:32.470
I wanted to make you aware how to achieve both.
