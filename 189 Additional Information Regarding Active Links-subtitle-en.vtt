So I want to leave the realm of Route parameters and so on soon.

00:06.610 --> 00:13.360
One more thing I want to do though we have to add homilies which is not marked as active when being

00:13.420 --> 00:17.150
on a single post and it kind of makes sense by the label of it.

00:17.440 --> 00:22.910
But what if this was named posts which would make sense because we have a lot of posts there.

00:22.930 --> 00:26.720
So let's maybe rename that link to be posts.

00:27.190 --> 00:34.410
If we do this now it will be strange that it's not highlighted when we are on a single post.

00:34.450 --> 00:43.420
We certainly would want is not a reason for this of course is exect since exect is set this only is

00:43.420 --> 00:48.570
treated as active if we well have exactly this.

00:48.580 --> 00:55.040
You are at L and just slash and not slash free which we have of course for the post with ID.

00:55.060 --> 01:01.150
The problem is that if we remove exactly what we saw that before now it will be marked as active for

01:01.150 --> 01:04.810
a single post but also for a new post.

01:04.900 --> 01:11.340
So this is kind of tricky and it's only really tricky for this exact case that we're talking about do

01:11.340 --> 01:13.010
you root you are l.

01:13.120 --> 01:19.600
If we have slashed posts then it will be a different story and we could absolutely use this prefix because

01:19.600 --> 01:23.760
we probably have no conflicts with our routes in the application.

01:23.770 --> 01:30.850
It's really just that rude or else this rude POV of just slash which happens to be part of any page

01:30.880 --> 01:32.060
in our app.

01:32.200 --> 01:37.610
So this is just an edge case here a special case and I'm going to add exact again.

01:37.650 --> 01:40.720
Therefore not getting highlighting for a single post.

01:40.720 --> 01:46.120
And again it is fine for me because this is an added case which you will rarely face.

01:46.120 --> 01:53.950
Most of the time your posts are going to be at slash posts and I'm just not changing it here to deliberately

01:54.070 --> 01:57.200
leave this case here for reference.

01:57.220 --> 01:59.450
I just wanted to bring this to your awareness.

01:59.470 --> 02:03.130
You can face issues when using the root POV.

02:03.190 --> 02:08.190
Just slash and you want to style some chawl components but not all of them.

02:08.290 --> 02:11.550
So some parts which follow it but not all POS.

02:11.560 --> 02:13.210
This is really tricky to do.

02:13.210 --> 02:14.580
Not really possible.

02:14.680 --> 02:20.510
You typically use more specific routes like Slash posts though so this shouldn't be an issue.
