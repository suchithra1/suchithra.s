Not it's not just react.

00:04.030 --> 00:08.330
There are also alternatives re-act of course is what we'll cover in this course.

00:08.380 --> 00:14.350
But there also is Engler and there would be viewed chaos and there are avarice like backbone or amber

00:14.380 --> 00:17.730
but angular and view are the most popular alternatives.

00:17.950 --> 00:22.330
And I can only recommend diving into DS to to really pick your favorite.

00:22.330 --> 00:25.250
I also got courses on them if you are interested.

00:25.600 --> 00:32.500
All three of them are great at creating highly scalable web applications that look and feel good to

00:32.500 --> 00:34.090
the user.

00:34.090 --> 00:41.050
Not so much an alternative as Jake where he you might think it is one but Shakeri is really only about

00:41.350 --> 00:44.820
traversing the dorm and targeting elements in a dorm.

00:44.830 --> 00:51.490
Now as you saw in our example re-act is about just declaring what you see and focusing on the logic

00:51.790 --> 00:59.050
instead on focusing on the how and therefore react angular and view allow you to create more powerful

00:59.050 --> 01:05.860
applications because you can focus on the logic and your business model and not so much on the technical

01:05.860 --> 01:08.450
side of actually reaching dead element.

01:08.500 --> 01:09.670
You wanted to change.
