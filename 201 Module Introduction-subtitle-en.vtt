Back we are an hour Bergere project.

00:05.200 --> 00:12.460
Time to add some routeing to it and use the things we learned at the last course module in a real re-act

00:12.460 --> 00:14.150
application.

00:14.350 --> 00:20.560
Now definitely feel free to jump ahead from time to time possed video and implement some feature.

00:20.560 --> 00:24.580
I'm about to show you to practice using the router.

00:25.060 --> 00:32.760
I want to start by adding a page which allows us to actually check our Bergere out read no check out

00:32.760 --> 00:33.550
it looks like this.

00:33.550 --> 00:39.700
We add an ingredient we click order now we click continue and then we already send the request to the

00:39.700 --> 00:43.890
back and to submit that burger and to save it there.

00:43.960 --> 00:50.980
Now I'd like to change this so that I have to actually enter some information in a check out for him

00:51.220 --> 00:54.000
before we really save the burger.

00:54.250 --> 00:59.130
So this should be the first page I want to have at check out page.

00:59.140 --> 01:05.630
I also have a link here at the top which might allow us to navigate there though will probably replaced

01:05.630 --> 01:10.620
us for this module with my orders page because that makes more sense.

01:10.630 --> 01:16.840
But let's start with the checkout component and let's start with Boulding debt in the next lecture.

01:16.840 --> 01:21.610
Definitely feel free to jump ahead and bullshit on your own but also feel free to do it together with

01:21.610 --> 01:27.520
me because obviously there are a lot of different ways of creating check out component and creating

01:27.520 --> 01:32.330
the component itself is a nice practice but not really related to routing.

01:32.380 --> 01:33.700
See you in the next lecture.
