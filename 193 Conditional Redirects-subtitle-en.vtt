In the last lecture we learned about redirect.

00:04.790 --> 00:08.130
Now let me show you a number usage of redirect.

00:08.130 --> 00:13.790
Actually in the new post component dare we probably want to redirect.

00:13.800 --> 00:21.600
Once we clicked the submit button your and once we made our HDP request we often don't want to change

00:21.600 --> 00:26.490
the page and not remain on that page using the redirect component.

00:26.490 --> 00:27.940
We can easily do that.

00:28.230 --> 00:36.470
We can import read direct from re-act router Dom just like before.

00:36.570 --> 00:43.320
Now if we place redirect in GSX here outside of a switch statement we always have to redirect with the

00:43.320 --> 00:46.970
two property though we can't use from.

00:46.980 --> 00:50.240
So here we could redirect to slash posts.

00:50.250 --> 00:57.690
For example the issue with that of course is now if I save to code like this if we click onto new post

00:58.290 --> 01:04.190
we are immediately redirected back to posts because the redirect component is rendered and when whenever

01:04.190 --> 01:06.600
this is rendered it redirects us.

01:06.600 --> 01:09.480
So we have no chance of entering content.

01:09.600 --> 01:12.500
Therefore we need to render this conditionally.

01:12.750 --> 01:20.130
And since it's a normal component as all of this re-act router is we just have to render it conditionally

01:20.400 --> 01:23.400
as we render any other content conditionally.

01:23.400 --> 01:25.500
So we could add a new state here.

01:25.580 --> 01:31.590
Maybe submitted which initially is false which we then set to true.

01:31.710 --> 01:40.210
Once we made the HTP request so there alcohol said state and said submitted to true.

01:40.220 --> 01:45.180
Now I can use submitted to determine whether or not to render redirect.

01:45.450 --> 01:51.060
So in the render method I could have a redirect variable which is null by default.

01:51.440 --> 01:59.390
But then I'd check if this state submitted is true and if it is then redirect is equal to that redirect

01:59.390 --> 02:06.290
component and then I return J as X which includes that redirect variable which is even now or do you

02:06.290 --> 02:07.850
redirect component.

02:07.850 --> 02:16.640
If we save dat code we can successfully go to new post but as soon as I do submit a post and it is hitting

02:16.640 --> 02:21.840
the server I am redirected with a conditional redirect.

02:21.860 --> 02:26.310
Now this is our way of using redirect outside of us which statement.

02:26.390 --> 02:30.460
Not with Thrawn but instead deconditioned just is.

02:30.470 --> 02:37.700
Did something happen so that I want to render this component and then we only render it when we want

02:37.700 --> 02:38.750
to redirect.

02:38.810 --> 02:45.440
Might feel strange at first that you render a component to leave the page but this is just how it works.
