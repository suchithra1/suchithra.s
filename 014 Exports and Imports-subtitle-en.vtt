00:02.290 --> 00:09.990
Another feature which Next-Generation javascript offers is about writing modular code so javascript

00:09.990 --> 00:12.980
code you split up over multiple files.

00:13.170 --> 00:17.500
And obviously we already can split our code over multiple files.

00:17.670 --> 00:22.720
We just have to import them in the correct order in our age html files.

00:22.920 --> 00:30.060
And the idea behind export and import statements and so-called modules is that inside of a javascript

00:30.060 --> 00:37.260
file we can import content from a number of file so that the javascript files themselves know their

00:37.260 --> 00:38.850
dependencies.

00:38.850 --> 00:40.510
It might look like this.

00:40.530 --> 00:46.830
We have one fall person touch us and there we have this constant person which stores a javascript object

00:47.430 --> 00:49.380
and then this is the interesting part.

00:49.440 --> 00:57.210
We export this the default keyword all does a special keyword marking this as the default export of

00:57.210 --> 01:04.290
this file and we can import this somewhere else and the import statement will be shown in a second.

01:04.290 --> 01:10.620
We also might have a number of fall where we export multiple things here a constant named clean which

01:10.620 --> 01:15.810
holds a function dnt and base data which holds a number in a third file.

01:15.810 --> 01:24.130
We might need to import from person yes and utility to us so apt or genius requires import statements.

01:24.180 --> 01:29.970
And here are a couple of different import syntax as you will see in the score's person JSE as you see

01:30.250 --> 01:38.460
uses the default keyword the default keyword simply means if we just import something from that file

01:38.670 --> 01:40.890
it will always be our default export.

01:40.890 --> 01:49.470
So in this case a person constant therefore in implored person from person yes we can name person whatever

01:49.470 --> 01:54.480
we want which is why a printed twice year person or P R S doesn't matter.

01:54.480 --> 02:00.940
It always refers to the thing you marked as the default with the default keyword for utility.

02:00.990 --> 02:03.240
Yes it's a bit different there.

02:03.390 --> 02:13.050
We import from two different constants and therefore the import syntax uses the curly braces to explicitly

02:13.050 --> 02:16.170
target specific things from that file.

02:16.170 --> 02:21.890
These are so-called named exports because we import the stuff by its name.

02:21.900 --> 02:28.500
We import the clean constant by its name and we import Baystate by its name because we didn't mark anything

02:28.500 --> 02:29.410
as the default.

02:29.520 --> 02:35.870
So for javascript to know what exactly were pointing to we need to give it the exact name and the name

02:35.870 --> 02:37.860
goes between call embraces.

02:37.950 --> 02:43.770
By the way you could also write this as one import statement with Baystate a comma clean or the other

02:43.770 --> 02:44.870
way around.

02:44.880 --> 02:47.910
So these are imports and exports.

02:47.970 --> 02:53.570
You write all of this in your javascript files and will heavily use this for all the scores.

02:53.760 --> 03:00.420
Now as with all these next generation javascript features it won't run like this in all browsers.

03:00.420 --> 03:05.460
Not even the most modern browsers support all the features will use in this project.

03:05.460 --> 03:11.700
Therefore in the next course module I'll also show you how to quickly set up a project which in the

03:11.710 --> 03:18.330
end just compounds all these next generation javascript features to current generalised good features

03:18.630 --> 03:24.720
so that we as a developer can use the next generation javascript without us shipping code that runs

03:24.720 --> 03:25.940
nowhere.

03:25.980 --> 03:28.090
So back to the imports and exports.

03:28.090 --> 03:32.290
This is the syntax we use and you will see getting use a lot in this course.

03:32.310 --> 03:38.370
You might also see some variations because we can also write this differently when we have a default

03:38.400 --> 03:39.330
export.

03:39.330 --> 03:44.700
You already saw that person is the name you can choose totally on your own.

03:44.760 --> 03:47.970
It doesn't matter here if you use person or PR s.

03:48.210 --> 03:54.450
If you have a named export you actually have to use the exact name defined in the file with the export

03:54.450 --> 03:55.770
keyword.

03:55.770 --> 03:57.400
Still what you can do.

03:57.480 --> 04:03.540
You can assign an alias which you then again can freely choose in the file you are importing it with

04:03.540 --> 04:09.510
the as keyword or if you have multiple named exports in a file.

04:09.510 --> 04:16.940
You can import everything with this start special character and then assign an alias and bundled.

04:16.950 --> 04:23.340
In this case would be a javascript object which exposes all constants and whatever you export in the

04:23.580 --> 04:31.320
file as properties so that you simply have bundled Daut based data bundled Daut clean to access the

04:31.320 --> 04:32.430
export of things.

04:32.460 --> 04:36.780
That's up to you and you will see me use these things for all the course.

04:36.780 --> 04:39.020
The most common use search is the top one.

04:39.030 --> 04:41.700
Import Cauley braes something called the raise from.
