00:02.360 --> 00:10.040
Well I come to this module where we will learn how we can send h to requests from our re-act application

00:10.040 --> 00:17.390
to a server because re-act of course is a library which allows you to create the front end of your application.

00:17.390 --> 00:22.530
Basically the HVM our code the thing the code running in the browser.

00:22.670 --> 00:27.660
And if you're creating a single page application something you're often doing with react.

00:27.830 --> 00:35.720
Then you have an even more decoupled application more decoupled from your back and therefore it's of

00:35.720 --> 00:42.200
course important to understand how you can actually send aid to the P Or since we have that decoupling

00:42.200 --> 00:50.000
going on A-check request specifically from your re-act front and from your javascript code to your server

00:50.000 --> 00:51.800
side back end.

00:51.830 --> 00:54.680
Now let me show you how this works in the next lecture.

00:54.770 --> 00:59.780
And then of course let me show you how to actually implement it into a re-act application.

00:59.900 --> 01:01.340
Throughout this module.
