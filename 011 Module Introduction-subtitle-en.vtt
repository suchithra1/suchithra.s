Welcome to dismantle in this chorus I'm going to say it right away.

00:06.520 --> 00:08.480
This module is optional.

00:08.590 --> 00:15.780
If you already know next generation javascript so things like Aero functions let Konst and so on.

00:15.880 --> 00:22.450
You may very volts gipped this module does modulus for you if you know javascript but haven't worked

00:22.450 --> 00:30.040
with ESX or any ABA worship of a script then javascript as we use it in this course might sometimes

00:30.040 --> 00:35.680
look like a new language to you because of all the next generation of features react Eppes typically

00:35.680 --> 00:36.600
use.

00:36.730 --> 00:41.960
Now I'm not using these next generation features because I want to show off or anything like that.

00:42.100 --> 00:48.250
React EBS typically are built with the latest version of javascript and using the next gen features

00:48.590 --> 00:55.240
allows us to write clean and robust re-act apps react and solve using a lot of Next Generation Chalis

00:55.240 --> 00:56.150
good features.

00:56.380 --> 01:01.780
Therefore it's important for you to understand all these features and not be confused by this.

01:01.870 --> 01:06.020
Sometimes really strange looking words of javascript.

01:06.220 --> 01:12.310
Javascript is evolving quickly and therefore new features can look different but really allow us as

01:12.310 --> 01:15.330
a developer to do more powerful things.

01:15.370 --> 01:21.420
This Marshallese for you I will want you frood a core features we use in this Chloris so that the code

01:21.470 --> 01:24.700
thereafter hopefully looks a bit less strange to you.

01:24.820 --> 01:28.460
And again feel free to skip this module if you already know it.

01:28.510 --> 01:33.460
Feel free to always come back to it if you later in the course encounter something that looks strange

01:33.460 --> 01:34.210
to you.
